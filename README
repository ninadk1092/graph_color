The code returns whether the given graph(in the form of adjacency matrix) is a bipartite graph. 
The algorithm runs with a complexity of n^n. Focus was only in implementing the algorithm first. Efficiency considerations will come in version 1.1.
Version 1.0 of the code can execute the algorithm for any combination provided in the form of adjacency matrix, but ONLY FOR 9 NODES.

The folder needs the following functions in their independent files for executing. 
main.c 		//contains the <int main()> and takes the graph as input from in_graph.txt
randomize.c	//to start with a randomized starting case to ensure the working in a generic case
print.c		//to print the edited current array at any point in the algo
in_graph.txt	//contains the adjacency matrix of the input graph
